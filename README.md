# LaTeX-templates
My LaTeX templates for daily use.

* cnhomework.tex: A simple template for homework written in **Chinese**. It contains some basic usage of LaTeX, enough for literature courses, and you can add something else. To successfully make it run, Please use XeLaTeX to compile.

* IEEE Conference LaTeX Template: Standard LaTeX template for IEEE
* Chinese journal: a revised version of a template for **Chinese Journal of Computers**. This template is for my thesis of Psychics 2020. **Please note that this is not for formal use.**
